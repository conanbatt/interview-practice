// 2. *Robot in a Grid*: 

// Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of a grid with r rows and c columns. 
// The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are 
// "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them.
// Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.
