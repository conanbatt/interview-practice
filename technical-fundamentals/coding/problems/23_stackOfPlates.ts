// 3. *Stack of Plates*:

// Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
// Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack
// exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this.
// SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once
// the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave
// identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if
// there were just a single stack).

// FOLLOW UP: Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.

export default class StackOfPlates<T> {
    constructor(capacity: number) {

    }

    push(value: T): void {

    pop(): T | undefined {
